### General setup
SYSTEM = 1500K    # The title string for identification.
NPAR = 2          # Determines the number of bands that are treated in parallel. ~sqrt(# of cores).
ISTART = 0        # Whether or not to read the WAVECAR file.

### Electronic structure part
PREC = Normal     # The precision mode.
ALGO = Very Fast  # The electronic minimization algorithm.
LREAL = A         # Whether the projection operators are evalulated in real-space or reciprocal space.
ISMEAR = 1        # How the partial occupancies are set for each orbital.
SIGMA = 0.2       # The width of the smearing in eV.
ISYM = 0          # The way symmetry is treated.
EDIFF = 1E-5      # The global break condition for the electronic SC-loop.
MAXMIX = 15       # The maximum number of steps stored in Broyden mixer.
NELMIN = 2        # The minimum number of electronic SCF steps.
NELM = 250        # The maximum number of electronic SC steps wich may be performed.

### MD part
IBRION = 0        # Determines how the ions are updated and moved.
MDALGO = 2        # The molecular dynamics simulation protocol.
SMASS = 1         # Controls the velocities during ab-initio molecular dynamics run.
POTIM = 4.0       # Time step fs.
NSW = 4000        # The maximum number of ionic steps.
TEBEG = 1500      # Initial temperatures set by Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. 
TEEND = 1500      # Ending temperature.

### Output part
NWRITE = 1        # How much will be written to OUTCAR.
NBLOCK = 1        # Ionic steps the pair correlation function and DOS are calculated.
LCHARG = .FALSE.  # Determines whether the carge densitites are written.
LWAVE = .FALSE.   # Determines whether the wavefunctions are written.
