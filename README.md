# AIMD Run Creator and Analyzer

This tool aids in the production of standard Ab-Initio Molecular Dyanmics (AIMD) isothermal runs.

## Running

Under each main working directory, there are general directories containing the following:

'''
executables: Contains bash files that provide input arguments to python scripts when applicable.
scripts: Contains analysis scripts that may have some input parameters within.
data: Where data is saved.
'''

## Coding Style

Python scripts follow PEP 8 guidelines. A usefull tool to use to check a coding style is pycodestyle.

```
pycodestyle <script>
```
